1. I have done some preliminary skimming of the .csv files
that we will be running analysis on, and thinking of directions
we can take this project based on the 311 fields we have like complaint type,
case status, neighborhood, etc. Our team met last week to discuss the project's
outline and just to get to know each other.

2. Next, I want to start to get a feel for different data "massaging" techniques we
want to explore with the 311 .csv's. Pandas and Pytorch are 2 libraries that both I and
the team need to have a grasp on for us to maximize what we can do with the data. I think 
an interesting route we can take is how we can illustrate the mass eugentrification of Boston's
neighborhoods over the past 10 years, and how that has affected the types of complaints that
are filed.

3. Since we just started, I don't have any blockers or issues to report. I think we are all
in a good place individually and as a group.

4. We have not spoken with the client or spark representative yet. But I think we are all on board
with doing so next week.
